	<h4>Who are we</h4>
	<div class="text">
		<p>Shopping is as much about the experience as it is about the things you buy. At thinkberry’s Market we have taken this principle to heart, re-creating the ambience of an old-fashioned marketplace in a modern theatre-of-food setting. Visiting one of our stores truly is an experience like no other.</p>
